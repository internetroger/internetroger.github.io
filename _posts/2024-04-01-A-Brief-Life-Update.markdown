A lot has happened since I started this blog and embarked upon a career in tech. As the pandemic wore on in the summer of 2020, I struggled to find work as a junior software engineer. I decided to explore staffing agencies, which were a common source of finding my way into jobs in the past.

I stumbled upon [CampusPoint](https://www.campuspoint.com/Home), a firm that specializes in finding positions for recent graduates. After setting up an account and a brief intake interview, I began applying for openings through their system. A few weeks later I landed a role at [Realself](https://realself.com) as an IT support person. That turned out to be a nice fit, and I stayed and grew with the company for 3.5 years. I joined the  POEITS (platform and operations engineering, IT, security) team which turned out to be a good home for me. I realized I'd rather support and develop infrastructure rather than write application code. 

Unfortunately I was laid off this January. I'd been through 2 rounds of layoffs before, but was still kind of blindsided by it. The job hunt has been difficult so far, so I know I'm not the only one :sweat_smile: As a result, I decided to head back to school and turn some coursework I was doing prior to Flatiron School into a [degree and some certifications](https://northseattle.edu/programs/information-technology/network-server-administration-aas-degree). "Regular school" has never been a strong suit of mine, but I feel ready to perservere and invest in myself. 

### Onward and upward :rocket:
