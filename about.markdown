![Hi, it's me!](me.jpg){:class="img-responsive" :height="500px" width="300px"}


Hello! My name is Roger, and I'm a software development student at the Flatiron School in Seattle. I graduated with a BA in the Liberal Arts from St. John's College and promptly left academia for a career in the trades. After working for 9 years as a welder, carpenter, and commercial fisherman, I've decided to try working with my head instead of my hands. Ask me about: rock climbing, carpentry, welding, Linux, online privacy, FOSS software, cycling (both motor and otherwise), and my dog!
