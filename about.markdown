![Hi, it's me!](/assets/pxArt.png){:height="50%" width="50%}

Hello! My name is Roger, and I'm an IT guy in West Seattle. I graduated with a BA in the Liberal Arts from St. John's College and promptly left academia for a career in the trades. After working for 10 years as a welder, carpenter, and commercial fisherman, I've decided to try working with my head instead of my hands. Ask me about: rock climbing, carpentry, welding, Linux, online privacy, FOSS software, cycling, and my dog!
